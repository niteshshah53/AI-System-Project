# Wumpus World Escape Assignment

This project implements a PDDL-based planner to solve the Wumpus World Escape problem. The agent's goal is to find a path out of the Wumpus world using various actions like walking, pushing, shooting, unlocking, and jumping.

- `maps`: Contains the input map files for the Wumpus world.
- `plan_files`: Stores the raw PDDL plans generated by the planner.
- `problem_files`: Contains the PDDL problem files generated from the maps.
- `solution_files`: Stores the final formatted solutions.
- `execute_plan.py`: Script to convert raw PDDL plans to formatted solutions.
- `generate_problem.py`: Script to generate PDDL problem files from map files.
- `main.py`: Main script to orchestrate the solving process.
- `verify.py`: Script to verify the correctness of solutions.
- `wumpus_domain.pddl`: The PDDL domain file defining the Wumpus world rules and actions.

## Dependencies

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. Fast Downward planner

### Installing Dependencies

1. Python 3:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

2. Fast Downward:
   Clone the Fast Downward repository and build it:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aibasel/downward.git
   cd downward
   ./build.py
   ```
   Make sure to update the `planner` path in `main.py` to point to your Fast Downward installation.

## How to Run the Program

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/TEAM660
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python3 main.py <maps_folder> <start_index> <end_index>
   ```
   Replace `<maps_folder>` with the path to the folder containing your map files, and `<start_index>` and `<end_index>` with the range of map indices you want to process.

   Example:
   ```
   python3 main.py maps 0 10
   ```
   This will process maps from map000.txt to map009.txt in the 'maps' folder.

## Expected Output

For each processed map, the program will generate:

1. A PDDL problem file in the `problem_files` directory.
2. A raw PDDL plan file in the `plan_files` directory (if a solution is found).
3. A formatted solution file in the `solution_files` directory.

The console output will show:
- Progress for each map being processed.
- The locations of generated files for each map.
- A summary of how many maps were successfully solved.
- Information about any maps that couldn't be solved.

## Verifying Solutions

To verify the correctness of the generated solutions:

```
python3 verify.py <map_file> <solution_file>
```

Replace `<map_file>` with the path to a map file and `<solution_file>` with the path to its corresponding solution file.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues, ensure all Python scripts have execute permissions:
  ```
  chmod +x *.py
  ```
- If the planner fails to find solutions for complex maps, try adjusting the search algorithm in `main.py`. You can experiment with different Fast Downward configurations.
