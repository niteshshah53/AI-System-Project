# AI System Project

This repository contains a collection of AI system implementations and assignments that demonstrate various artificial intelligence concepts and techniques. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of AI problem-solving and implementation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several assignments, each focusing on different AI concepts:

### A1.0 - Warmup
Initial warmup exercises to get familiar with AI concepts and programming.

### A1.1 - Finding Best Train Connection
Implementation of pathfinding algorithms to find optimal train connections between stations.

### A1.2 - Play FAUhalma
Implementation of an AI agent to play the FAUhalma game, demonstrating game theory and strategic decision-making.

### A1.3 - Solve Nonograms
An AI system to solve Nonogram puzzles, showcasing constraint satisfaction and logical reasoning.

### A1.4 - Query Publication using RDF SPARQL
Implementation of semantic web technologies using RDF and SPARQL for querying publication data.

### A1.5 - Escape the Wumpus Cave
An AI agent implementation to navigate and escape from the Wumpus Cave, demonstrating knowledge representation and reasoning.
