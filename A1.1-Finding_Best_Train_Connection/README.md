<h1 align="center" id="title">Find train connections</h1>

<p id="description">Using a data set of Indian railway times find the best connection between any two places according to different cost functions.</p>

  
  
<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Find the train connection with cost function 'Stops' using Directed Graph
*   Find the train connection with cost function 'traveltime' using Directed Graph
*   Find the train connection with cost function 'price' using Directed Graph
*   Find the train connection with cost function 'arrivaltime HH:MM:SS' using Directed Graph
*   Verify.py script to check you example solution
