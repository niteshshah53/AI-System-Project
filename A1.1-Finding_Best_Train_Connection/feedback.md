-----------------

There were some formatting issues with train numbers in some of the problems, in addition to several bad costs and non optimal costs.  
I would have liked to see more clarification about how you constructed the grid on which you applied the heuristic for your A* search. I haven't seen it used in this assignment before, and I can't really imagine how it works. Dijkstra's algorithm could have still worked for the arrival time problems, the challenge there would have been more about how to handle the graph.
